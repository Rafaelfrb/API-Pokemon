# API-Pokemon

This is my first project using API to automatically get objects and, with it, create elements in my index.html. 

I used my last pokedex project as a model and created this new one with the major difference being the use of API. 
I also created a new styling so it does not look so much alike the last one and I learned more about CSS in doing so.
